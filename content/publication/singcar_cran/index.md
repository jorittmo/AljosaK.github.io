abstract: "Case-control comparisons are a class of statistical tests allowing researchers
    to compare single cases to populations estimated from a sample. Such tests have
    wide potential utility, but historically have been applied mostly in the fields
    of cognitive and clinical neuropsychology, to infer whether individuals have
    suffered significant cognitive changes as the consequence of a brain lesion. One
    may wish to estimate whether that individual has abnormally low performance on
    some cognitive ability, or if one cognitive ability is abnormally discrepant
    with respect to another cognitive ability. Several related methods have been
    developed to test for abnormality on a single variate and abnormality of the
    difference between two variates when a single case is compared to a small
    sample, while controlling the Type I error rate. These methods include Bayesian
    regression techniques for significance testing in the presence of covariates.
    This paper describes the most popular methods for this class of statistical
    tests and presents the R package singcar, in which they are implemented along
    with associated power calculators."
