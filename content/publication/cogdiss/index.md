abstract: A study using an incomplete repeated measures design was performed to investigate 
  whether a construction of other peoples’ associative mappings 
  (in this case stimulus-outcome mappings) in 33 subjects could occur when observing another
  person’s facial expression while they perform a conditional discrimination task with differential
  value-based outcomes, and if such construction could facilitate the subjects’ own learning 
  when afterwards performing the same task. Through this, providing 
  evidence for the use of such constructions as a mechanism aiding individuals
  engaged in joint activities, including so called joint action. A significantly better 
  performance was observed when such construction was possible in comparison with a
  condition where it was not, indicating that the construction of others’ associative
  mappings do occur, at least in conditional discrimination tasks. To further strengthen
  the indication that better performance was due to construction of the other’s associ-
  ative mappings and that this construction emerged due to social processing, EEG
  activity was measured during the task and compared to activity measured during a
  similar, though non-social, task. Oscillatory differences in EEG between conditions
  was used as an index of social perception. Differences in power/synchronisation over
  the alpha, beta and mu band between the conditions were analysed. All bands showed
  a significant increase in power in the social condition, although mu was expected to
  show the reversed pattern. Alpha increase may suggest inhibition of the self-perspective
  and beta increase could be related to processing of emotionally valanced stimuli
  or use of executive functions – both results may indicate that the social condition
  was perceived as social.
