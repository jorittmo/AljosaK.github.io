abstract: "Researchers and clinicians in neuropsychology often compare
  individual patients against healthy control samples, to quantify evidence for
  cognitive-behavioural deficits and dissociations.  Statistical methods for these
  comparisons have been developed that control Type I (false positive) errors
  effectively. However, remark-ably little attention has been given to the power
  of these tests. In this practical primer, we describe, in minimally technical
  terms, the origins and limits of power for case-control comparisons. We argue
  that power calculations can play useful roles in single-case study design and
  interpretation, and we make suggestions for optimising power in practice.  As
  well as providing figures, tables and tools for estimating the power of
  case-control comparisons, we hope to assist researchers insetting realistic
  expectations for what such tests can achieve in general."
