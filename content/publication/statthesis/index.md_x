abstract: A review of the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) along with its appropriateness
  under various conditions is presented. In particular, the thesis addresses how different
  covariance structures plausible in brain imaging, and strengths of the correlations between
  dependent variables in simulated variable systems affect the power of the analysis in relation
  to various combinations of effect sizes. The aim was to illuminate these relationships and
  offer insights in contingencies yielding the highest power, aiding researchers in designing
  powerful experiments. Simulations revealed that the most improbable conditions yielded the
  highest power, i.e. when effect sizes differed in size and/or direction, but the correlation was
  highly positive or when the effect sizes and directions were equal but the correlation highly
  negative. Similar patterns have been demonstrated before (Cole, Maxwell, Arvey, & Salas,
  1994) but the present thesis offers a generalisation, demonstrating that the effect is present
  for an arbitrary number of dependent variables and groups. Furthermore, it is shown that
  multivariate analyses exhibit lower power when effect sizes are small as compared to medium
  even in situations where 6 variables exhibit a small effect compared to 1 of the variables
  exhibiting a medium effect. Difficulties in controlling the Type 1 error rate are addressed as
  well.
