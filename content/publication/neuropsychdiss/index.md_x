abstract: "Single case studies where a brain damaged patient is compared to a normative
  control group have historically been crucial for neuropsychology. Some authors
  have argued that the methodology is fundamentally flawed, others that it is the
  only way to draw valid inferences of cognition. Whether the case, the usage of
  the method has declined. Reasons for this might be several but difficulties in
  working with a clinical population and publication pressures have been cited
  as possible culprits. This is while statistical methods for the paradigm have
  been appropriately refined and developed, mainly by John Crawford and Paul
  Garthwaite, during the last 22 years. These methods have given a field often
  viewed as “merely anecdotal” a much needed rigour. The present work first
  aims to evaluate these tools with regards to statistical power, keeping with the
  increased focus on power for evaluating validity of scientific fields. In general
  power was, unexpectedly, found to be low. Low power is known to generate
  consistent overestimations of effect sizes, so the extent to which such error
  estimation is affecting the field was quantified and correction methods suggested.
  Secondly, to encourage the use of the refined tools developed, the present work
  aims to make them more accessible by i) implementing recommended hypothesis
  tests along with power calculators in an R package: `singcar` ii) providing a
  basic conceptual intuition behind the need for their development. Lastly, the
  future of single case neuropsychology is discussed."
