Data and Cognitive scientist researching methodological and statistical issues in
cognitive neuroscience. Interested in how to use data ranging in size from very
small to very large for understanding human behaviour and experience.
My posts here serve as a digital garden and it will hopefully thrive and prosper
along with my own growth. Posts might include theory, code or best practices. 
Most probably, though, a mixture of the three. If you are really unlucky I'll let
some of my short stories slip in. I am enthusiastic about the power of predictive
modelling but also wary of its limitations. Let us responsibly see what the
future might bring!
