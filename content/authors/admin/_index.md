Brain damaged brain student writing about methodological and statistical issues in cognitive neuroscience, 
as well as other related topics. If I feel inclined I might write more technical 
posts and if you're real unlucky there might even slip in some fiction book reviews. I will only post
about my mental fatigue when I have the energy.
