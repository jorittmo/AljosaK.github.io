Brain damaged brain student researching methodological and statistical issues in
cognitive neuroscience. Interested in how to use data ranging in size from very
small to very large for understanding human behaviour and experience. My posts
here are as much a digital garden as it is a blog, hopefully it will thrive with
me, along with both technical proficiency and personal growth.
