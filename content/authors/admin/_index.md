Data and Cognitive scientist researching methodological and statistical issues
in cognitive neuroscience. Interested in how to use data ranging in size from
very small to very large for understanding human behaviour and experience. I'll
probably write most about technical stuff but if you are really unlucky I'll let
some of my short stories slip in. I am enthusiastic about the power of
predictive modelling but also wary of its limitations.
