abstract: |
  The findings of differential outcomes training procedures in controlled stimulusresponse learning settings have been explained through    theorizing two processes of response control. These processes concern: i) a stimulus-response route, and, ii) an outcome expectancy route through which valuations of stimuli (typically auditory or visual) may be represented. Critically, under certain contingencies of learning, the interaction of these two processes enables a transfer of knowledge. Transfer is hypothesized to occur via implicit inference for response selection given novel stimulus-response pairings. In this article, we test this transfer of knowledge, previously only examined in individual settings, in novel social settings. We find that participants are able to achieve transfer of knowledge and suggest they achieve this through vicariously learning the differential valuations of stimuli made by the (confederate) ‘other’ involved in the task. We test this effect under two experimental conditions through manipulation of the information made available to participants observing the confederate other’s choices. The results of EEG recordings are, additionally, evaluated and discussed in the context of social signalling and emotional and cognitive empathy. We also consider implications for clinical and technological social learning settings.

Introduction
==========================

Differential outcomes training (DOT) is a well-studied procedure for evaluating the
learning capabilities of humans and non-human animals on forced choice tasks and where
rewarding outcomes differ according to the trial-specific preceding cue stimulus. 
The procedure concerns presenting to subjects, on each trial, a stimulus 
shortly followed bytwo or more behavioural response options for which the ‘correct’ response produces an
outcome. However, in contrast to classical behavioural experiments whereby the same
reinforcing outcome is presented following correct stimulus cued responses, DOT entails
rewarding (or at least non-negative) outcomes specific (differential) to a given stimulusresponse
‘pair’. An example of a DOT trial could be: i) the presentation of a picture
showing a particular time of day, ii) a subsequent delay, and iii) then the presentation of
two more pictures showing two different types of prescription drugs only one of which
should be pointed to (correct response) in order to obtain iv) a differential rewarding
outcome (see @plaza2018learning for similar procedure). Subjects that are trained by DOT
typically learn more quickly than when the outcomes are non-differential (classical
approach). This result is known as the differential outcomes effect [@trapold1970expectancies; @urcuioli2005behavioral]

The differential outcomes effect has been studied with respect to child development
[@esteban2014differential; @estevez2001differential; @lowe2014neural; @maki1995expectancies; @martinez2013effects], and has been found to provide a measure of, and ameliorate, clinical deficits in a number of neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s [@carmona2019differential; @molina2015differential; @plaza2012improving], Autism [@addison_examination_2006; @mccormack2017differential] and Down syndrome [@estevez2003differential]. The effect has also been found to be robust to non-clinical adult training [@miller2002differential; @mok2009neural; @plaza2018learning].

For an excellent meta-analysis on the various different methodologies (and applicable
effect sizes) found that incorporate DOT (as applied to animals and clinical/non-clinical
human children and adult participants) see @mccormack2019quantifying. The differential
outcomes effect has been consistently found using an instrumental procedure consistingof 
a number of independent repetitions (trials) where the stimulus-response-outcome (SR-O)
contingencies remain the same throughout. An alternative application of DOT,
however, has been to administer *three* stages of learning: Stage 1, instrumental (as for the
standard DOT); Stage 2, Pavlovian (only stimuli and outcomes are presented, participants
are passive during this stage, i.e. cannot produce a response); Stage 3, instrumental (test
phase). In Stage 2 subjects are presented with novel stimuli that, through training, can
come to be associated with those outcomes experienced in Stage 1, while in Stage 3,
subjects are tested for their ability to transfer the knowledge gained over the first two
stages to a test stage comprising the presentation of stimuli from Stage 2 and responses
from Stage 1.

The above so-called *transfer of control* (ToC) procedure has also been applied to children
[@maki1995expectancies], non-clinical adults [@hall2003acquired] and non-human animals, e.g.
pigeons [@meehan1999class; @peterson1980effects] demonstrating that differential
outcomes training procedures as opposed to non- or same-outcome procedures yield
transfer of instrumental knowledge to new instrumental contingencies. This has been
explained (is predicted) by the Associative Two-Process theory [@lowe2016minimalist;
@trapold1970expectancies; @urcuioli2005behavioral]. By this theory DOT is suggested to
lead, in subjects, to the formation of differential expectations of outcomes that can be
associated with stimuli and responses (‘prospective process’) whereas stimuli and responses
can also be associated as per the standard instrumental learning theory (‘retrospective process’). 

A typical ToC procedure is illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1a shows (top) the S-R-O contingencies of
each of the three stages of the procedure, and (bottom) the Associative Two-Process
predictions that are made. The key point is that by the transfer test stage (Stage 3) when
subjects are presented with the stimuli from Stage 2 and the responses from Stage 1
subjects are able to draw on associative knowledge of differential Stimulus-(Outcome)-Expectation 
(S-E) (from Stage 2) and Expectation-Response (E-R) pairings (from Stage
1) that enable them to infer the correct response for those Stage 2 stimuli in the
instrumental test (Stage 3) in spite of never previously having been presented with these
particular Stimulus-Response pairs. By Associative Two-Process theory subjects have
learned S-E and E-R associations, and that forms a *transitive bridge* from which to infer
non-learned particular S-R pairings (Figure 1, right).

\end{figure}



The common finding of the Transfer of Control (ToC) version of Differential Outcomes
training is that Associative Two-Process theory predicts performance in the instrumental
test phase where subjects tend to select a particular response in the initial trials of this
stage, relative to a control condition (in this case a shared-outcome condition), which
suggests little or no learning is occurring but rather a form of associative (‘implicit’)
inference.

In spite of the numerous forms of ToC and the consistent result found in humans and 
nonhuman animals performing as individual subjects/participants, to the best of the authors’
knowledge, such training procedures have yet to be applied to human (or animal)
participants in a social context. In @lowe2016minimalist we suggested that adapting the
Pavlovian stage to a form of passive observation in a social context would allow to test
hypotheses as to whether participants can transfer knowledge learned from their own
instrumental experience (Stage 1) and that within the passive social context (Stage 2) to
novel instrumental selection in the standard test phase (Stage 3). Drawing on a review of
how value systems are represented for *self* and *other* in joint activities
[@ruff2014neurobiology], we (in @lowe2016minimalist) hypothesized that participants would be
able to vicariously learn the value observed for the other where the
context is non-competitive. This is to say that participants experience the other’s stimuli and
outcomes presentations as if they weretheir own and update their value function (differential
reward outcome expectations) accordingly. 

This is in contrast to the competing hypothesis that
individuals represent the value of self and other in separate neural-psychological substrates
[@ruff2014neurobiology]. In the latter case a separate value representation of other would not have
been associated with the individual’s previously experienced responses (Stage 1) thereby
prohibiting the formation of the above-discussed *transitive bridge*. 

A presupposition here is that
in cases where individuals are able to view the other participant in the task, in perceiving the
expressive state, they may empathize with the expresser through *emotional contagion*
[@hatfield1993emotional]. Emotional contagion may occur through facial feedback
[@adelmann1989facial]– *emotional empathy*. But another means of emotion expression recognition 
concerns cognitive emotion recognition [@drimalla2019face; @dziobek2011neuronal] – *cognitive empathy*. 
In emotional empathy, this corresponds to a mimicry of the expresser leading to subconscious 
emotion recognition (a vicarious feeling) as a result of
mirror neuron activation (e.g. @wicker2003both; @singer2009social; @hess2013emotional). 
In cognitive empathy, recognition entails inference of the expresser’s mental states
based on the emotion expressed [@baron2004empathy] or imagined – the
empathizer puts him/herself in the shoes of the emoter (vicarious inference).

## The present study

This article reports the method and findings of two experiments aimed at evaluating
whether: a) transfer of control (ToC) effects based on a differential outcomes training
procedure can apply in a social setting, b) such ToC effects, if found, owe to vicarious
value learning. In relation to a), Experiment 1 manipulated social setting by way of a
condition providing stimulus-outcome feedback to participants of the performance of a
screen-recorded (but with no face visible) *other* (confederate) with only audio feedback
and with response feedback hidden. Experiment 2 manipulated social setting by showing
only stimulus-emotion expression feedback of the performance of a videoed other
(confederate) with perceptible facial feedback but no audio or response feedback from
the confederate and no explicit outcome feedback provided. In relation to b), Experiment
1 thereby assessed a more conceptual/cognitive social setting to evaluate how sensitive
the ToC effect might be to perceived social conditions (vicarious inference), whereas
Experiment 2 assessed a more explicit/emotion expressed social setting with facial
affective feedback substituting for the explicit outcome that the other participant received
(vicarious feeling). From @lowe2016minimalist it is predicted that if participants represent
the value of outcomes (reward-based) of the other according to separate neuralpsychological
mechanisms, then the ToC effect should not occur. It is predicted that
vicarious value learning is required for ToC effects to occur in a social context of the type
that would not obviously benefit from tracking self and other performance 
(i.e. is noncompetitive; see @lowe2016minimalist). Thus, it is hypothesized that for both
Experiment 1 and 2, if participants produce ToC results in the experimental (differential outcomes)
condition that differ from the non-differential outcomes control, vicarious value learning
is occurring by either cognitive or emotional empathic means. Participants are
hypothesized to transfer knowledge of outcomes learning in perceived others to their own
instrumental responses. Manipulating the type of perceptible transfer contingencies of
other – based on perceptible outcome (Experiment 1) and perceptible emotional
expression (emotional contagion) from which to infer outcome (Experiment 2) – provided
a means for assessing the robustness of the ToC to different controlled social contexts.
Finally, for Experiment 2, we further hypothesized that, given vicarious value learning
consistent results, EEG recordings would uncover mu suppression during the Pavlovian
phase of the experiment, i.e. while the confederate was observable (via facial expressions)
in the task. We base this hypothesis on evidence associating suppression of the EEG mu
rhythm, a rhythm in the alpha frequency range (~8-12 Hz) over sensorimotor areas, with
facial emotion processing [@enticott2008mirror]. This EEG measure provided us with a
validation measure of participant social processing additional to subjective
(questionnaire) feedback.

Experiment 1
============

## Method

### Participants

An a-priori power analysis was performed for sample size estimation in the software
package G*Power [@faul2007g] using the effect size specification option "as in
SPSS", the effect size found specifically for the ToC procedure obtained via a metaanalysis
study of @mccormack2019quantifying, $\eta^2$ = 0.33, power = .8, and $\alpha$ = .05 resulted in
N = 20. The participants were students from the University of Gothenburg aged between
20-44 years ($M_{age}$ = 27.74) with 9 males and 11 females. They participated in Experiment
1 for the reward of a cinema ticket.

### Design

The experiment followed a 2x2 repeated measures design where the four conditions were
as follows: i) Individual Differential Outcomes Training, ii) Individual Non-Differential
Outcomes Training, iii) Social Differential Outcomes Training, iv) Social NonDifferential 
Outcomes Training. Thus, there are two independent variables with two
levels each: i) Differential vs Non-Differential Outcomes training, ii) Individual vs Social
scenario. Each condition comprised a transfer of control (ToC) procedure consisting of 3
stages of 20 trials each.

### Materials and apparatus

Each participant was required to carry out each condition on a computer monitor where
they were to observe the presentation of stimuli and outcomes and produce mouse click
responses on available options. Stimuli images were taken from the Snodgrass
standardized image set [@snodgrass1980standardized] – six different images in each condition 
(24 in total). Additionally, audio feedback was provided for correct and incorrect responses.
We sampled sounds from the IADS (International Affective Digitized Sounds;
@bradley2007international) commensurate with differential outcomes for such audio feedback –
*positive* and *moderately positive* for correct feedback, *negative* for incorrect feedback.
A depiction of the experimental set-up and interactive task materials is provided in Figure 2.

Right, the set-up as experienced by participants in the Pavlovian stage (Stage 2) of the experiment for the social conditions (see text for more explanation). The bottom half of the *confederate monitor* (in brown) covered up the response choices made by the confederate so that only stimuli and outcomes were visible to the participant but not responses."}

```

### Procedure

An example of a single trial on Stage 1 can be visualized in Figure 3.

```{r figure3, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Trial progression Stage 1/3. For each trial the participant was presented with a stimulus superimposed on a white panel (top right) for 1000ms, followed by a blank/white (stimulus) panel for a further 2000ms, then two response options were presented at the bottom of the screen for 2000ms. The participants were required to respond (click on one of the two options) within the 2000ms time limit or a timeout and ‘incorrect’ feedback were presented. A correct response yielded an image of money (coins) that was either small (low reward) or large (high reward) and concomitantly increased the score bar (left-side horizontal column). An incorrect response (or no response) yielded a ‘no reward’ image and a reduction of the score bar."}

include_graphics("figure3.jpg")
 
```

Participants were given a pre-experiment warm-up phase to familiarize themselves with
the task during and after which questions were permissible. Stimuli used in this warm-up
phase were not used in the experimental conditions. Conditions were controlled for order
effects: Social conditions before or after Individual conditions; DOT before or after 
NonDOT conditions. Participants were not permitted to ask questions during the experimental
procedure. They were given oral instructions before the experiment and instructions and
prompts were also provided periodically on the monitor. Participants were informed that
they would receive a cinema ticket for participation and an additional ticket if they
achieved a sufficiently high score. The entire ToC procedure, including warm-up phase,
took around 30 minutes to complete. Following completion of the experiment (all four
conditions), participants were required to complete a questionnaire (see Appendix A).
Below is provided a description of each of the three stages of the ToC procedure.

All stimuli (images) presented to the participants were presented randomly, one per trial,
but such that there was always an equal number of each stimulus presented per stage.

### Stage 1 – Instrumental learning phase:

Twenty trials: Participants were required to learn to associate 2 different images (stimuli)
with appropriate responses (click on button option 1 or option 2) in order to get the
rewarding outcome. In the DOT condition, participants were required to associate high
reward with one stimulus (image) and low reward with the other stimulus. Incorrect
answers received a punishment (‘money’ loss). Participants were required to learn to
criterion here (4/5 correct responses by trial block 4): If participants did not learn at above
chance levels (2.5/5 for random guessing) by this stage, Stage 3 (transfer of knowledge)
was considered not applicable.

### Stage 2 – Pavlovian learning phase:

Twenty trials: Participants were required to learn to associate 4 new images (stimuli) with
rewarding outcomes. Outcomes again were comprised of high or low reward (as in Stage
1 where the same images and audio feedback were used for the differential outcomes). In
the DOT condition different stimuli reliably predicted high or low reward. In the NonDOT
condition different stimuli predicted reward but the reward could be either high or
low (randomly generated). In the social condition, participants viewed a screen-capture
and audio videoed performance (confederate) on a different monitor (see Figure 2
*confederate monitor*) and were told to observe and learn from the other’s stimulus-outcome
results. In the videoed performance the confederate responded incorrectly on the
first trial (met with incorrect buzzer feedback) but responded correctly on the final 19
trials. This was the case for both DOT and Non-DOT conditions. This approach was
chosen to increase the credibility of the confederate though it meant that the social
conditions’ Stage 2 was slightly more difficult than the individual conditions’ Stage 2
(individual DOT and Non-DOT Stage 2 always provided correct stimulus-outcome
pairings).

### Stage 3 – Instrumental transfer test phase:

Twenty trials: As for Stage 1 participants again were required to associate images
(stimuli) with responses. But now it was required to associate the 4 images used in Stage
2 to the response options in Stage 1. Note, this constituted a new set of associations for
the participants to learn.


### Ethics

Participants were debriefed regarding their right to withdraw at any stage of the
experiment and were required to sign a consent form regarding participation and
anonymised publication of their data.

## Results

The analysis carried out concerns the two (instrumental) stages for which there were
behavioural choice performance data, i.e. Stage 1 and Stage 3. In Stage 1 we evaluated
performance (number of correct choices) for participants in the four conditions so as to
assess whether a differential outcomes effect was obtained. In Stage 3 we evaluated
performance to assess for transfer of control (ToC).

#### Stage 1 

In Figure 4 it is shown that, as a result of overlapping error bars, no differential outcomes
effect is found in Stage 1. That is, there is no difference in performance by the end of
Stage 1 in the differential outcomes training (DOT) versus the non-differential outcomes
training (Non-DOT) conditions in either individual or social conditions. This is to be
expected since Stage 1, based on our analysis of preceding pilot studies, was designed to
be sufficiently non-challenging so that participants would score well above chance.
Strong learning of instrumental contingencies in Stage 1 was a prerequisite for
transferring knowledge to the test phase (Stage 3) of transfer of control. Above chance
performance by individuals on Stage 3 who show no evidence of having learned on Stage
1 may owe to ‘lucky guesses’. The absence of difference in the four conditions is desirable
since differences in performance in the test phase (Stage 3) can more parsimoniously be attributed
to learning in the Pavlovian stage (Stage 2) over conditions and the nonpossibility 
of categorizing new stimuli presented in Stage 2 by common/same outcomes experienced in Stages 1 and 2.

#### Stage 3 

This instrumental stage tested the ability of participants to transfer knowledge gained
from Stage 1 (Instrumental) and Stage 2 (Pavlovian). Differences in performance between
DOT and Non-DOT conditions regarding transfer of control are summarized in the plots
in Figure 4.

```

Each block consists of 5 trials and in Stage 3 there are four different stimuli presented.
Chance performance, involving guess-work, would produce mean scores of 2.5 (0.5
chance of getting the correct response per trial). However, since presentation of stimuli
was randomized, participants were potentially presented several of the same stimuli
within the first block. Nevertheless, performance on the first block of trials was
considered to be the greatest indicator of transfer of control since *learning* effects (i.e. instrumental) 
in subsequent blocks (rather than direct transfer of knowledge) would be more likely to bring to bear.

A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was run with factors: *type of outcomes*
(differential versus non-differential), and *type of task* (social versus non-social). The
dependent variable was amount of correct responses (over the first block of 5 trials). A
significant effect of *type of outcomes* was found, $F$(`r xp1stats["type_out", "num Df"]`, `r xp1stats["type_out", "den Df"]`) = `r xp1stats["type_out", "approx F"] %>% round(3)`, $p=$ `r xp1stats["type_out", "Pr(>F)"] %>% round(3)`, partial $\eta^2 =$ `r xp1stats["type_out", "eta^2"] %>% round(3)`, with the DOT condition giving $M =$ `r xp1_sum_out["1", "mean"] %>% round(2)`, $SD =$ `r xp1_sum_out["1", "sd"] %>% round(3)`, Non-DOT condition $M =$ `r xp1_sum_out["2", "mean"] %>% round(3)`, $SD =$ `r xp1_sum_out["2", "sd"] %>% round(3)`.

Two participants’ data were removed for scoring only 3/5 on the last block of
stage 1, which we considered to be at or around ‘chance’^[See previous description of ‘chance’ performance in relation to Stage 3.] performance.

#### Subjective Report

Questionnaires on a 5-point Likert scale were provided to participants to assess the extent
of perceived emotional engagement in the task and also whether they experienced the
presence of the confederate participant (social condition). Appendix A provides the
results in full for the 11 questions administered and *t*-test statistical differences from the
‘baseline’ score of 3. One participant failed to complete the questionnaire and so our
analysis is based on 19 completed questionnaires.

## Discussion

The results presented above for Experiment 1 provide a proof of principle that the transfer
of control effect obtained when using differential outcomes training can apply in a ‘social’
setting and not just the non-social setting in which it has been previously studied. Stage
2 in the social condition served as a stage where participants were able to learn from the
video-presented stimulus-outcome pairings (Stimulus-Expectations; S-E) of a
confederate and bring to bear that knowledge on their own outcome expectation-response
(E-R) knowledge gained from Stage 1 forming thereby the *transitive bridge* hypothesized
as an explanation for individualized ToC learning. The argument put forward by @lowe2016minimalist
is that participants are able to learn from others according to a principle of
*vicarious value learning*. That is, participants utilize the same value representations
(reward outcome valuations of stimuli) for others as they do for themselves.

Experiment 2
============

## Method

### Participants

Thirty-three students from the University of Gothenburg participated in each of the four
conditions of Experiment 2 for the reward of a cinema ticket. The participants were aged
between 22-46 years ($M_{age} = 26.6$) with 23 males and 10 females. One participant was
excluded from the EEG analysis due to highly unreliable data not salvageable through the
standardised processing steps used for all other participants. Calculating the effect of
the contrast between differential and non-differential outcomes *within* the social level
yielded Cohen's $d=$ `r round(cd)`. Utilising this simple effect in a sample size calculation 
for a one-sided t-test (since our hypothesis is directional), with power $= .8$, $\alpha = .05$,
resulted in N = 29. 

### Design

The design was the same as for Study 1 with the addition of measure of EEG. The
dependent variable for the EEG activity was power spectral density over the mu
frequency band, which was extracted using fast Fourier transform (FFT). That is
amplitude in the 8-12Hz frequency obtained from C3 and C4, which is the typical site for
mu detection since these locations are positioned over the motor cortex. Additionally,
alpha band power over the frequencies 8-12Hz for all remaining electrodes was obtained
and averaged. These were measured and compared during the outcome presentation in
Stage 2 (Pavlovian phase) in the social and non-social conditions.

### Materials and apparatus

The materials were the same as for Experiment 1 with the exception of the stimuli in the
social condition and the addition of three questions in the questionnaire as well as slight
reformulations of the questions used in Experiment 1. In Stage 2 (Pavlovian phase), the
participant was presented a video of either the face of another person (confederate)
playing the game (social condition), or an animation (non-social condition). The function
of the animation was to have a comparably complex and informative stimulus, but that
would not be social and yet would keep participants focused during the inter-stimulus
interval. The animation consisted of a randomly moving shape where the outcome images
of Stage 1 were faded in at outcome presentation. In this way, the non-social video
provided sufficient information for the participants to be able to perform the stimulus-outcome pairing task.

### Objective measure of confederate emotional expression

Two confederates were used to play the role of confederate during the Pavlovian phase
for the social conditions. One was used in the warm-up stage and one in the experiment.
Each confederate was instructed to express happiness at receiving the high reward and
mild frustration at receiving low reward according to a pre-scheduled reward and cost
(punishment) schedule. As a means of assessing objectively differential facial expressions
we used the Noldus software FaceReader 8.0. Figure 5 shows this schedule for the
confederate used in the experimental condition (see Figure 6 for example expressions)
over the 20 trials (where high and low reward are generated by a random number
generator in the program and the first trial always gave a negative reward/punishment).

\end{figure}

In all but one case (trial 4) the confederate expressed according to the correct valence as
computed up by FaceReader (though the negative value in trial 4 is only slight in this case
and less negative than for all low or negative reward outcomes). An independent samples
*t*-test found a significant difference between low reward (including negative reward) vs
high reward expressions, 95% CI[-.86, -.43], $t(18) = -6.36$, $p<.001$. Figure 7 shows
example expressions taken from the 20 trial sequence for positive (Figure 6 left) and negative
(Figure 6 right) valence, respectively.

The outline box indicates the surface area over which FaceReader carries out the expression analysis. The numbered labels represent the Action Units that are expressed above baseline according to FaceReader."}

include_graphics("figure7.jpg")
 
```


It was observed that Action Units (see @ekman_facial_2002) 12, or AU12 (Lip Corner Puller), for positively
valenced expression and AU5 (Upper Lid Raiser) for negatively valenced expression
were most typically used. In the case of the former, AU12 in the absence of expression
of AU6 (cheek raiser) may be indicative of a non-Duchenne (social) smile or that
FaceReader did not pick up all micro-expressions of the confederate. See Experiment 2
Results Discussion sub-section for more detail.

### Electroencephalogram Recordings

The Electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition system OpenBCI Cyton board was used.
The Cyton board is an 8-channel neural interface, which samples data at 250Hz. Since
the present study did not analyse any higher frequency than 25Hz, such sampling rate was
deemed more than sufficient since only a sampling rate of 2.5 times that of the frequency
is required for analysis [@cantor2013clinical]. The board communicates wirelessly to a
computer via Bluetooth and the data was recorded using OpenBCI’s own graphical user
interface.

Further, the associated OpenBCI headset Mark IV was used. The headset is able to target
35 electrode locations of the 10-20 system. The locations used in Experiment 2 are those
of the original locations of the headset. After a pilot study using the device the original
electrode placements were shown to generate superior contact compared to other
locations and provided a coarse distributed signal across the scalp. The locations used
were: Fp1, Fp2, C3, C4, P7, P8, O1 and O2 according to the 10-20 system. Fp1, Fp2, O1
and O2 have previously been used for emotional detection [@musha1997feature]
and C3 and C4 are common locations for detecting mu rhythmicity
[@oberman2007human] the suppression in activity of which (in these central brain regions)
being considered to reflect mirror neuron activity [@hobson2016mu; @oberman2007human].

#### Data analysis

To transform and interpret EEG data, MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, United
States) and the EEGLAB toolbox [@delorme2004eeglab] were used. A semiautomatic
pipeline consisting of MATLAB-scripts imported the EEG data alongside
event markers (for events such as stimuli and outcome presentation for the various
stages), filtered it (4-45 Hz including a notch between 48.5 and 52.5 Hz), ran independent
component analysis, removed artefacts caused by eye-blinks or power line noise spikes
(re-referenced affected channels) and extracted descriptive statistics of the stages for each
participant.

### Procedure

The procedure used was similar to that of Experiment 1, with the difference that
participants now wore the EEG headset providing a means to evaluate participants during
the behaviourally passive Stage 2 (Pavlovian stage). Throughout the experiment, the
participants were asked to sit as still as possible without feeling unnaturally hindered
during the task. The main task-based difference between Experiment 1 and Experiment 2
was the use of videos (visual) without audio in the Pavlovian phase (Stage 2) of the
experiment. The social video was designed to: a) increase the sense of social presence, b)
allow for emotional expressions to provide a means for vicarious value learning through
emotional contagion. The explicit responses and outcomes of the confederate were not
shown so participants were required to make stimulus-emotional expression associations
(see Figure 7 for trial progression) that through emotional contagion might directly tap
into the other’s (stimulus) value representation.

```{r figure7, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Trial progression Stage 2. Left. Non-social animated stimulus. Right. Social video stimulus (confederate). For each trial the participant was presented with a stimulus superimposed on the right white panel (top right) for 1000ms, followed by a blank/white (stimulus) panel for a further 2000ms. The video sequence in both social and non-social conditions endured for the whole trial (left white panel). The video stimulus substituted for explicit outcomes (see Figure 3) in the social condition so that the expression of the confederate provided the only cue as to the outcomes (high reward / low reward). All but the first trial was expressed as reward – the punishment/negative reward (shocked expression), as used in Experiment 1, was intended to increase believability in the confederate. In the non-social condition outcomes were made explicit (faded in, see left bottom screen). The animation video in this non-social condition was used to control for the fact that the social condition now also used a video. The score bar (left side of screen) remained at that which the participant had achieved in Stage 1."}

include_graphics("figure8.jpg")
 
```

### Ethics

The ethical considerations and procedure were as for those of Experiment 1. In addition,
participants were informed prior to the study of the uncomfortableness of the EEG
headset and that they may interrupt the study at any time.

## Results

The behavioural task performance results are presented in the same way and with the
same logic as for Experiment 1, i.e. Stage 1 and Stage 3 analyses. Stage 2 is now analysed
using EEG data: comparisons of mu and alpha band power is analysed for the social and
non-social conditions.

### Stage 1

Figure 8 shows, as for Experiment 1, no differential outcomes effect (stage 1) in terms of
differences in means between differential outcomes (DOT) and non-differential outcomes
(Non-DOT) conditions. As for Experiment 1, this is desirable as we can then more
reasonably attribute in Stage 3 differences between DOT and Non-DOT in transfer of
control performance to the stages and the non-possibility of categorizing new stimuli
presented in Stage 2 by common outcomes experienced in Stages 1 and 2.

A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was run with factors: *type of outcomes*
(differential versus non-differential), and *type of task* (social versus non-social). The
dependent variable was amount of correct responses in the first 5 of 12 possible responses, in Stage 3 and differences is shown in Figure 8.
A main effect of *type of outcomes* was found, $F$(`r xp2stats["type_out", "num Df"]`, `r xp2stats["type_out", "den Df"]`) = `r xp2stats["type_out", "approx F"] %>% round(3)`, $p=$ `r xp2stats["type_out", "Pr(>F)"] %>% round(3)`, partial $\eta^2 =$ `r xp2stats["type_out", "eta^2"] %>% round(3)`, with the amount of correct responses being higher for the differential outcomes ($M =$ `r xp2_sum_out["1", "mean"] %>% round(2)`, $SD =$ `r xp2_sum_out["1", "sd"] %>% round(3)` correct responses) than the non-differential outcomes ($M =$ `r xp2_sum_out["2", "mean"] %>% round(3)`, $SD =$ `r xp2_sum_out["2", "sd"] %>% round(3)` correct responses).

A paired-samples *t*-test was used to determine whether there was a significant mean
difference in participants’ mu band power between the social and non-social videos over
electrode C3 and C4. Participants showed an unexpected increase in mu band power when
observing the social videos ($M =$ `r round(mu_desc[1,1], 3)`, $SD =$ `r round(mu_desc[2,1], 3)` 
power spectral density) compared to
the non-social videos ($M =$ `r mu_desc[1,2] %>% round(3)`, $SD =$ `r mu_desc[2,2] %>% round(3)` 
power spectral density), a statistically significant mean increase of 0.29 in power spectral density was found, 95% CI [`r mu_test[["conf.int"]][1] %>% round(3)`, `r mu_test[["conf.int"]][2]%>% round(3)`], $t$( `r mu_test[["parameter"]][["df"]]`) = `r mu_test[["statistic"]][["t"]] %>% round(3)`, $p$ = `r mu_test[["p.value"]] %>% round(3)`, $d =$ `r mu_effect %>% round(3)`.
Furthermore, to potentially explain the unexpected
direction of the mu effect, a paired-samples *t*-test was used to determine whether there
was a significant mean difference between social and non-social videos in 8-12 Hz (alpha
band frequency range) amplitude averaged over the remaining electrodes, that is Fp1,

### Subjective report

```{r subrep, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

cron_alpha <- psych::alpha(exp2_quest, check.keys = TRUE)$total$std.alpha

```


Questionnaires on a 7-point Likert scale were provided to participants to assess the extent
of perceived emotional engagement in the task and also whether they experienced the
presence of the confederate participant (social condition). Appendix B provides the
results in full for the 14 questions administered and *t*-test statistical differences from the
‘baseline’ score of 4. Due to a relatively low internal consistency 
(Cronbach's alpha = `r round(cron_alpha, 3)`), these results are interpreted cautiously. Admittedly
it would be of interest to factorise the items in the questionnaire and regress the number of correct responses
in Stage 3 on factor scores for "emotional" items. However, due to the low internal consistency and a poor
sampling adequacy ($KMO=$ `r KMO(exp2_quest)[["MSA"]] %>% round(3)`) we could not justify such approach. 

## Discussion

The results indicate that, as for Experiment 1, a transfer of control for differential
outcomes based training in a social context occurs. This conclusion is based on the
significant difference in forced choice performance in the test phase (Stage 3) of the
differential outcomes conditions versus the non-differential outcomes condition where no
interaction effect of sociality (social versus non-social conditions) was found. In this
experiment, therefore, participants appear to have been able to learn from the affective
expression of the confederate the value of the novel stimuli and transfer this knowledge
as well as that of E-R based associations learned in Stage 1 to the test phase Stage 3.
Again, participants, at the beginning of Stage 3, have had no exposure to the particular
SR pairings that are relevant to obtain the rewarding outcomes. The EEG findings, relevant
to providing a measure of perceived social presence in participants, require some
interpretation. The finding of an increase in mu band power was the opposite of that
hypothesized, however, a possible explanation for this might be inadequate separation
from alpha indicated by the subsequent alpha analysis. It is therefore important to
interpret these results in the context of the social versus non-social conditions and what
cognitive and affective resources may have been brought to bear. The video (social versus
non-social) independent variable had no significant effect on the amount of correct
responses, also as expected. The subjective report (questionnaire) findings also lend
support to participants either cognitively or emotionally empathizing with the
confederate. Whilst it was not explicitly asked of participants whether they apprehended
that the confederate was indeed a confederate – for fear of affecting future data collection
– no impressions were given by the participants that they considered the ‘other’
participant to be inauthentic. Expressions of the confederates (particularly the confederate
used in Stage 2 of the Experiment, as opposed to the training phase) did not, therefore,
appear to be perceived as ‘socialized’ (e.g. non-Duchenne smile) or fake.

General Discussion
============

The present article presents work aimed at evaluating whether the differential outcomes
based transfer of control effect^[This concerns transferring knowledge from previous task 
stages to a third stage without the requirement of new learning.] (ToC) as predicted by the
Associative Two-Process theory [@trapold1970expectancies; @urcuioli2005behavioral] could apply
in social contexts. The social contextsexperimentally evaluated how a perceived other’s outcomes
might be inferred: i) through direct presentation of stimulus-outcome contingencies, ii) through
indirect presentation of outcomes as conveyed by the other’s affective facial expression. The main
finding of our investigation was that the ToC effect can apply in social contexts and was robust to
the change in contingencies (i. and ii. above) as manipulated in the two experimental
conditions reported here.

We have considered a hypothesis and explanation for this *social* ToC according to
vicarious value learning [@lowe2016minimalist; @ruff2014neurobiology] whereby through
evaluating another’s rewarding outcomes, the perceiver updates his/her own value
function – effectively putting him/herself in the shoes of the other. This was manipulated
to occur either through direct perception of the other’s (differential) outcomes (as in
Experiment 1), or through cognitive or emotional empathizing [@drimalla2019face] via
affective processing of the facial expression of other (Experiment 2). In the latter case,
facial expressions corresponded to the differential outcomes, or rather reactions to them.

A main source of interest was to consider to what extent the participants viewed the
participating other (confederate) as being present and as the context thereby being
“social”. In Experiment 1 and 2 we evaluated this through the use of questionnaires
whereby participant subjective reporting provided some evidence of vicarious value
learning. The Social Affective-Associative Two Process hypothesis [@lowe2016minimalist]
posits that in non-competitive situations an individual may learn the value function of
another vicariously through emotional contagion as a result of observing the affective
expression of the other. A reinforcement learning model was described that has been
successfully deployed to explain transfer of control (ToC) performance in individual
subjects (pigeons, rats) in non-social settings [@lowe2017affective; @lowe2017affective1].
Although the computational model has not so far been used to model the current data it
is expected that according to the vicarious value learning perspective it should replicate
the qualitative performance of the individual ToC. This would be the case simply because
individuals are hypothesized to use the same value function to valuate stimuli presented
to them as they would stimuli presented to the other. A ToC should not result if a separate
value function for other is represented (e.g. in a competitive context, see @suzuki2012learning, for an example reinforcement learning model).

The task was deliberately set up to require participants to produce fast responses (time
out and negative reward was presented for slow responding). The aim here was to
promote learning by subconscious associative processes rather than by any other such
cognitive strategies. However, we cannot rule out that such cognitive strategies were
being used at least by a subset of the participants some of the time. Participants may have
been using a type of cognitive empathy ([@drimalla2019face]) whereby the affective
expressions of the confederate other were evaluated and understood but not in a manner
that directly tapped into vicarious value learning (e.g. through emotional contagion). 

The uncovering of a social presence signal – mu suppression – as an indicator of mirror neuron
activity would have provided evidence for a vicarious value learning strategy, however
in Experiment 2 the opposite result was found. It is suggested that this effect is a product
of inconsistent set-up of the EEG-headset and that it was not really mu rhythmicity that
was detected at all. @oberman2007human, for example, suggested that their detection of
mu, recorded at C3, Cz and C4, might be contaminated by posterior alpha activity since
the two bands overlap, even though they took effort to control for this. @klimesch2007eeg
proposed that during action observation mu rhythm should desynchronise but that
areas involved in action planning such as the supplementary motor area (SMA), adjacent
to the pre- and primary motor cortex, should exhibit increased synchronisation. Findings
from @muthukumaraswamy2004changes and @muthukumaraswamy2004mu
provide some support for this claim as they recorded 8-12 Hz desynchronizations over
sensory-motor areas, and indeed, a synchronisation of alpha over SMA during action
observation. 

We postulate, therefore, that the synchronisation of mu over C3 and C4 has
to do with the inconsistent set-up of the headset which possibly resulted in the
contamination of alpha synchronisation from SMA consistent with the possibility of
suppression of egocentric activity (self-planning) during perceived other responseoutcome 
events. In the present research increased alpha band power was found in the
social conditions as compared to the non-social (baseline) conditions. An implication of
this is that measuring alpha synchronisation over SMA could constitute a neural signature
for the processing of social stimuli. However, further research, in combination with
simultaneous mu (de)synchronization effects is necessary to be carried out. The presence
of both would provide stronger evidence for the existence of vicarious value learning
according to emotional contagion.

Future study is aimed at testing further the existence of vicarious value learning through
Social Affective-Associative Two Process hypothesis, e.g. in competitive versus 
noncompetitive contexts. We are also interested in using computational models of this
process for synthetic studies, i.e. human-robot interaction (see @lowe2009dual; @lowe2013exploring;
@kiryazov2013role; @alenljung2017user; @andreasson2018affective; @lowe2019vicarious; for examples)
as a further means of apprehending the validity of such
affective-cognitive processing and in the context of ‘minimalist’ joint activity (or joint
action) research [@vesper2010minimal], which focuses on the use of associative mechanisms
to produce intelligent collaborative behaviour.
